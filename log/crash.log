ESPN's Paul Biancardi was tasked with finding sleepers outside of ESPN's top 25 players who would outperform the rankings, and <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/9231151/top-five-sleepers-final-2013-espn-100-player-rankings\">struck upon Derrick Walton</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>1. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/102632/derrick-walton\">Derrick Walton</a>, PG, Michigan        <br />Final ESPN 100 rank: No. 30</b>      <br />? Walton, who will replace Burke and take the mantle as Michigan's point guard, has some similar traits to Burke as he is small, tough and competitive. Although we have Walton ranked No. 30, which is relatively high, he still has to fight for everything he earns -- which is what makes him special. Walton will lead the Wolverines and will have a wealth of talent around him with a mixture of scorers, size and a strong incoming freshman class coming in with him. Look for him to push the pace with a high-speed dribble and find teammates off penetration with his peripheral vision. Walton is battle tested and has played on the travel team circuit against some of the nation's best point guards and had his way. Don't be surprised to see him get more assists than points in any given game, yet he can also make big shots when his team needs them most. He is a clutch performer with the perfect mindset for his position. The opportunity is there for Walton; look for him to capitalize on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then Reggie Rankin was tasked with doing so with recruiting classes outside the top ten and picked three of the next four<a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/9234719/top-five-sleeper-recruiting-classes-2013-basketball-class-rankings\">, one of which happens to be M</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>2. <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/classrankings/rank?rank=12&amp;class=2013&amp;date=20130501\">Michigan</a> (No. 12 class) </b>      <br />The Wolverines have added three ESPN 100 prospects who are not only talented and will excel in John Beilein's system, but also who address some of the team's needs after losing <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/67086/trey-burke\">Trey Burke</a> and Tim Hardaway Jr. to the NBA. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/102632/derrick-walton\">Derrick Walton</a> is an excellent point guard who pushes the pace and can deliver the rock at high speeds or execute when the defense is set. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/103531/zak-irvin\">Zak Irvin</a> is a quick fix on the wing because of his size, athleticism and ability to flat-out get buckets with his aggressive approach on the offensive end of the floor. Power forward <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/140197/mark-donnal\">Mark Donnal</a> is skilled and can finish in the paint or stretch the defense with his range to about 18 feet. This class will excel in Beilein's system because all three have the IQ and skills to make high-level plays. Expect this Michigan class to be an NCAA tournament mainstay as long as it is together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are not bold forays onto the limb, but they do say nice things about Michigan, and from two different people. I might have gone with Donnal as more of a sleeper than the #30 player in the class, since Donnal's headed for a perfect fit for Beilein's offense and could blow up into a huge matchup issue down the road. </p>\n<p>BTW, ESPN moved Zak Irvin up to #22, their last five-star spot, and Walton rose 10-20 spots as well, IIRC. I told Seth this and he was bored, because this is always what Beilein recruits do. </p>\n<p><strong>Now do it with your arms behind your back.</strong> Devin Gardner hits Jeremy Gallon with his eyes closed: </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/2hnigfyavctbqujzwegdxqkqz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"yfrog.com - Image And Video Hosting\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://a.yfrog.com/img89/4386/nigfyavctbqujzwegdxqkq.mp4\" /></a></p>\n<p>No, Jeremy Gallon did not change his hair and severely reduce his resemblance to Snoop from the Wire. No he did not. Shush.</p>\n<p>In other news, this bodes well for throws made when Gardner is sneezing next fall. You'll have to think up something other than a field made of cat hair, Mr. Dantonio, if you're going to boringly cackle your way to victory this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>He may be biased, but the numbers are going his way</strong>. Netflix's CEO <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/netflix-ceo-says-future-of-tv-is-in-apps/2013/04/26/f21f5cce-adc7-11e2-98ef-d1072ed3cc27_story.html\">talks up the future of TV</a> and includes some numbers: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The number of consumers turning to Netflix <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/verizon-cablevision-emerge-as-unlikely-allies-of-cable-customers-fed-up-with-bundling/2013/03/19/11fe0dac-900d-11e2-9cfd-36d6c9b5d7ad_story.html\">and other online entertainment providers</a> has taken even Wall Street by surprise. Netflix has 30 million U.S. subscribers, a bit more than HBO and about 9 million more than the nation's biggest cable company, Comcast. Hastings audaciously projected Netflix's audience to grow to as many as 90 million as it expands globally. Its revenue, which exceeded $1 billion for the first three months of 2013, was a record. Minutes after the figures were announced Monday, Netflix stock soared more than 23 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eventually this will turn into various streaming buckets of content you can take or leave as you please, thus undermining the Big Ten's desire to expand into areas that have a lot of people who don't really care to watch Rutgers and Maryland play. </p>\n<p><strong>You might have to turn in your card.</strong> Brandon <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2013/04/michigans_dave_brandon_defends.html\">on the ticket hike</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>&quot;We raised the ticket prices, but we wanted to make sure the ticket price increase was not at all perceived to be an opportunity for us to make more money off of the students,&quot; Brandon said. &quot;The incremental revenue that comes from the student ticket price increase, we're going to contribute (that) to the rec sports program up on campus -- which has nothing to do with Michigan athletics, but it's a way that we can take those revenues and support something that will benefit all the students.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So? instead of letting the students who play rec sports pay for rec sports, everyone who wants a football ticket pays for rec sports? That doesn't seem particularly Repub?[POLITICAL CONTENT REDACTED].</p>\n<p>He does make an assertion that maybe if the tickets are more expensive students will be more inclined to use them that seems plausible. As previously mentioned, I don't think that'll move the needle with many out-of-state students with money to burn. Meanwhile, any student will be able to buy tickets no matter how disinclined he or she is to use them: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Michigan has no plans to cut the size of its student section inside Michigan Stadium -- which is roughly 22,000 seats.</p>\n<p>&quot;Every student who wants to buy a ticket will have the opportunity to buy a ticket,&quot; Brandon said. &quot;That hasn't changed, and that's the way it's always been.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That's the way it's always been?</em> Dave Brandon used this as an argument <em>in favor</em> of something? I am going to go lie down and panic at the possibility I have fallen into the mirror universe. </p>\n<p><strong>On the other hand, the angle of the sun will be right.</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoriSchmidt/status/329667800685744129\">Thumbs up</a> to this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OSU's Gene Smith says he has also spoken to Michigan's David Brandon and there is a consensus that &quot;The Game&quot; should be played at noon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's the way it's always been? I guess?</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes the burden of proof should be on you</strong>. Remember that Duke player who put down 30k in cash and got a 70k loan for some jewelry in 2009? This is <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2013/04/30/duke-lance-thomas-ncaa-no-violations/2124611/\">how the investigation went</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NCAA:</strong> Jeweler guy. Do you want to talk to us?</p>\n<p><strong>Jeweler:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>NCAA:</strong> What about you, Lance Thomas?</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>NCAA:</strong> Okay we're done here. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2013/04/30/duke-lance-thomas-ncaa-no-violations/2124611/\">no violations</a>, but much eyerolling. Just dump the amateurism business so no one has to care about Lance Thomas buying some jewelry. Not only is it immoral; it's also unenforceable. This is not a winner.</p>\n<p>Speaking of, Patrick Hruby <a href=\"http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/46368934/\">won't stop bombing the NCAA</a>, and it's beautiful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Between 1985 and 2010, they report, the average salary of head football coaches at 44 Division I schools increased by <em>750 percent</em>, from $273,300 to $2,054,700. During the same period, the average salary of university presidents rose by 90 percent, while the average salary of full professors rose just 30 percent.</p>\n<p>Which group is more essential to the collegiate educational mission?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/5/2/4292914/sec-network-steve-spurrier-players\">The OBC</a> is on board with paying guys.

{badarg,[{erlang,apply,[[{feed_item,"feed_item-3","Code as Craft","March 2013 Site Performance Report","<p>Four more months have gone by since our <a href=\"http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/11/09/october-2012-site-performance-report/\">last update</a>, and it's time for another performance report!  We made it through the holiday season with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/blog/news/2013/etsy-statistics-december-2012-weather-report/\">flying colors</a>, and our engineers have been hard at work launching new features since the new year started.  Let's see what impact this had on performance (spoiler: we keep getting faster).</p>\n<p><strong>Server Side Performance:</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the median and 95th percentile load times for signed in users on our core pages on Thursday, 3/14/13:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-02.png\"><img alt=\"Server Side Performance Chart\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3201\" height=\"644\" src=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-02.png?w=531&#038;h=644\" width=\"531\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see we had small decreases in load time across the board (the one exception being a tiny uptick in median search performance).  We expected this, since we made a couple of small changes to our application code in the last couple of months that had a positive impact across every page.  The larger decrease in the 95th percentile load time for the homepage was primarily due to the <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/help/article/3897\">removal of the Taste Test</a> module.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder, the \"Baseline\" page is an extremely simple page that just includes our header and footer, and uses our normal controller architecture.  Improvements in the load time of this page mean improvements across every page on Etsy.</p>\n<p>We also thought it would be fun to look back and compare our performance today to our performance from the <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/blog/news/2011/tech-update-page-load/\">very first performance report</a>, back in August of 2011.  Since we don't look at averages anymore, we can only compare the 95th percentile:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-04.png\"><img alt=\"Performance comparison 1.5 years\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3202\" height=\"573\" src=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-04.png?w=531&#038;h=573\" width=\"531\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking good!  We have made huge strides on the homepage, shop page, and profile page, and a small improvement on the search page.  The listing page hasn&#8217;t seen much optimization given its position as the fastest of these pages, so we&#8217;re happy with its modest gains.  It's extremely gratifying to see how much progress we have made over the last ~18 months, and we hope to continue this trend in the months to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Front-end Performance:</strong></p>\n<p>We changed our strategy for monitoring front-end performance in our last update, and promised more stable metrics going forward.  That proved to be the case:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-03.png\"><img alt=\"Frontend Performance - March 2013\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3203\" height=\"644\" src=\"http://etsycodeascraft.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/server-side-performance-chart-4-2013-03.png?w=531&#038;h=644\" width=\"531\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Performance looks good here as well &#8211; reductions in load time for almost every page type again.  The one outlier here is our baseline page, which saw a significant increase in document complete time since our last update.  We've started digging into this, and it looks like a couple of extra HTTP requests have snuck into this page &#8211; a JS file and a sprite or two.  We'll be consolidating these requests in the coming days and we expect to see the document complete time on this page drop back down.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As far as the rest of the improvements go, we believe that they are due to a combination of changes that we've deliberately made to improve performance, and a better hit rate at our CDNs.  We are currently load balancing static content across multiple CDNs, and we've worked to improve cachability so that fewer requests have to hit our origin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall we are happy with the way performance has been trending, especially because we've been focusing our efforts over the last 4 months on projects that don't involve these core pages.  For the next couple of quarters our plan is to establish clear performance SLAs and bring all of our major pages into compliance with them.  Beyond that we are always looking for big wins and evaluating new standards like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY\">SPDY</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jonathanklein.net/2013/02/a-comprehensive-guide-to-webp.html\">WebP</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_prefetching\">pre-fetching</a> to see if they make sense for Etsy.  It's an exciting time to be working on web performance!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Does this sound like something you would like to work on?  Our team is <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/careers/job_description.php?job_id=oTdaXfwX\">hiring</a>!</em></p>\n<p><em>You can follow Jonathan on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanklein\">@jonathanklein</a></em></p>\n<br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/etsycodeascraft.wordpress.com/3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/etsycodeascraft.wordpress.com/3200/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=codeascraft.etsy.com&#038;blog=16220466&#038;post=3200&#038;subd=etsycodeascraft&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />","Jonathan Klein","http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2013/04/09/march-2013-site-performance-report/",{{2013,4,10},{1,41,14}},"btewari",false}],set,[]],[]},{rsstrackerd_main_controller,markread,4,[{file,"/Users/btewari/Documents/hacking/erlang/rsstrackerd/src/controller/rsstrackerd_main_controller.erl"},{line,30}]},{boss_web_controller,execute_action,5,[{file,"src/boss/boss_web_controller.erl"},{line,821}]},{boss_web_controller,process_dynamic_request,5,[{file,"src/boss/boss_web_controller.erl"},{line,530}]},{boss_web_controller,process_request,5,[{file,"src/boss/boss_web_controller.erl"},{line,519}]},{timer,tc,3,[{file,"timer.erl"},{line,194}]},{boss_web_controller,build_dynamic_response,4,[{file,"src/boss/boss_web_controller.erl"},{line,453}]},{mochiweb_http,headers,5,[{file,"src/mochiweb_http.erl"},{line,94}]}]}2013-05-09 15:16:55 =ERROR REPORT====
